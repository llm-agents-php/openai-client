## What's in the box?

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Run this command to add the package to your project:

```bash
composer require llm-agents/openai-client
```

2. That's it! You're ready to roll.

## Setting it up üîß

To get the OpenAI client up and running in your Spiral app, you need to register the bootloader. Here's how:

1. Open up your `app/src/Application/Kernel.php` file.

2. In your `Kernel` class, find or create the `defineBootloaders()` method and add the `OpenAIClientBootloader`:

```php
class Kernel extends \Spiral\Framework\Kernel
{
   public function defineBootloaders(): array
   {
       return [
           // ... other bootloaders ...
           \LLM\Agents\OpenAI\Client\Bootloader\OpenAIClientBootloader::class,
       ];
   }
}
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The package uses your OpenAI API key and organization (if you have one) to authenticate. Set these up in your `.env`
file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
